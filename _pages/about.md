Hi, I am <b> Md. Asif Haider </b> (you can simply call me <b>Asif</b>) from <b>Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>. I am a passionate undergraduate student with a never-ending interest in science and arts. I am into learning new things about technology and research methodology with an engineering mindset. Currently studying <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> as major at <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a> in my final semester.

I am currently doing my undergraduate thesis on LLMs in SE under the guidance of Professor <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAuiNFgAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anindya Iqbal</a> in collaboration with <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://toufiqueparag.github.io/toufique.github.io/">Dr. Toufique Ahmed</a>. My research interests include leveraging <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b> techniques to solve real-world problems in the fields of <b>Natural Language Processing</b> and <b>Software Engineering</b>. I am also interested to explore <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>Healthcare Informatics</b> and <b>Computational Social Science</b>.

I will be joining the CSE Department at the School of Data and Sciences in <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">BRAC University</a> as a lecturer from Fall 2024 semester.
